उ.प्र. में अधिकाधिक निवेश लाने हेतु निवेश प्रोत्साहन एजेंसी के तौर पर गठित 'इन्वेस्ट यूपी' , @investindia के साथ मिलकर कार्य करने के लिए सदैव तत्पर है।",".@UNCTAD का प्रतिष्ठित इन्वेस्टमेंट प्रमोशन अवार्ड 2020, @investindia को प्रदान किए जाने पर मैं आदरणीय PM श्री @narendramodi जी को सभी प्रदेशवासियों की ओर से बधाई देता हूं।

यह सम्मान भारत में व्यापार के अनुकूल वातावरण की स्थापना के प्रति वैश्विक स्वीकार्यता का प्राकट्य है। https://t.co/sr9KHUg6lH","जब देश कोरोना के खिलाफ महत्वपूर्ण लड़ाई को पूरी मजबूती के साथ लड़ रहा है। उस समय विपक्ष द्वारा भोले-भाले किसानों को गुमराह कर कोरोना के विरुद्ध समर को कमजोर करने का कुत्सित प्रयास किया जा रहा है।

आमजन के जीवन और स्वास्थ्य से खिलवाड़ का यह प्रयास कतई स्वीकार्य नहीं होगा।","आज भारत बंद का समर्थन कर अराजकता फैलाने वाले कांग्रेस समेत अनेक दल यह बताएं कि वर्ष 2010-11 के दौरान जिस यूपीए सरकार ने APMC एक्ट में व्यापक संशोधन की वकालत की थी और राज्यों के मुख्यमंत्रियों को इससे संबंधित पत्र लिखे थे, आखिर उस समय उन्होंने यूपीए सरकार का समर्थन क्यों किया था?","श्री मुलायम सिंह जी ने 2019 में कृषि से संबंधित स्टैंडिंग कमेटी में एपीएमसी मॉडल एक्ट में संशोधन को ""किसान हितैषी"" बताते हुए उसका समर्थन किया था।

फिर आज यह राजनीतिक दल भारत बंद का समर्थन किस मुंह से कर रहे हैं, इसका जवाब इन्हें देश की जनता को देना होगा।","मूल्यों व आदर्शों के बगैर राजनीति कभी जन विश्वास का प्रतीक नहीं बन सकती है।

वह सभी राजनीतिक दल, जिन्होंने कृषि संबंधी सुधार के इस महत्वपूर्ण कदम का सत्ता में रहते हुए समर्थन किया था, अपने इलेक्शन मेनिफेस्टो का हिस्सा बनाया था, आज उसका विरोध कर जन विश्वास पर कुठाराघात कर रहे हैं।","यूपीए सरकार में कांग्रेस व उसके सहयोगी दलों ने किसानों को हमेशा हथियार बनाया लेकिन किसान हित में कोई भी कदम उठाने में सदैव संकोच करते रहे। यह उनके दोहरे चरित्र को दर्शाता है।

यह दल आज भी भोले-भाले किसानों के कंधों पर बंदूक रख कर देश में अराजकता फैलाने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं।","केंद्र सरकार ने किसानों के हित में कृषि संबंधी सुधारों से जुड़े महत्वपूर्ण विधेयकों के माध्यम से पिछले 06 वर्षों में अनेक क्रांतिकारी कदम उठाए हैं।

किन्तु देश के कुछ राजनीतिक दल भोले-भाले किसानों को भ्रमित कर वातावरण खराब करने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं।"

Be inspired by this message from Joel, ""Invisible to the Enemy"". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/H5hJe30nju","When life tries to push you down, step on you, take your health, squash your dreams, you have to get back up again. Outlast what’s trying to defeat you. The power in you is greater than any power that’s trying to stop you.","God is about to take you higher. Things that have held you back are being broken. New doors are about to open, giants are about to be defeated, talent is about to come out of you that you didn’t know you had.","You may have difficulties now, in your health, your finances, your marriage. You could live worried and panicked. But when you know you’re in a safe place, where God has you hidden, then you can live in peace.","Victory starts in our minds.

Click here to watch, ""Invisible to the Enemy"": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/DMYDJoz7Af","Enemies may be knocking at your door: debt, trouble, sickness, calamity. Stay in peace; you’re invisible to the enemy. It may show up, but it’s not going to find you.",Faith and fear have something in common. They both ask us to believe something that we can’t see. Whichever one you get in agreement with is the one that’s going to come to pass.,"That difficulty is not how your story ends; God has the final say. He’s not only going to take care of what’s trying to stop you, but He’s going to bring you out better.","Trouble is not going to come near you. Why? You’re in the shelter of the Most High. He has you covered. He’s covered your health, covered your marriage, covered your children, covered your finances, covered your dreams.","God can make you invisible to the enemy. Plans that were sent to stop you, strategies designed to keep you from your destiny, cannot stand against our God.","God is your vindicator. He sees what’s happening. If you’ll stay on the high road, He’ll make it up to you.","If you’ll get rid of the bitterness, the offense, the critical spirit, the negativity, you’ll get your passion back; you’ll get that spring in your step. You’ll not only enjoy life more, but you’ll see God’s favor and blessings in new ways.","You have to trust the process. While you’re waiting, things are growing; things are developing. God is bringing it all together.","God called you an eagle; He created you to soar. Don’t let a sour attitude keep you grounded. It’s time to rise to new levels, to soar to new heights.

He will keep testing us till we learn the intended lesson. Keep learning! Life always has a lesson!","When you’re close to the Almighty, you’ll be extremely grounded. Nothing worldly will shake or affect you that you lose your sense of self. You’ll have inner peace. You won’t be easily provoked. You’re better able to control your anger. You’re calm in the face of adversity!","RT @Abdullahaiduk: WINTER WARMTH APPEAL!

And it’s certainly a preparation for when the door finally opens. It’s all to do with timing. The Lord of the Worlds knows when it’s best to give you what you’ve been asking for day and night!,"At times, the Almighty will slow you down just to protect you. A delay doesn’t mean denial. There’s evil ahead of you which you can’t see but He can. So don’t always be in a hurry. Read His signs. You’ll be forever grateful that you didn’t rush headlong into things. Slow down!",Learn to be fair. The Almighty loves those who are just. Sometimes you don’t like someone based on what others have said about him or someone else's description of him.

He knows what’s in your heart even before you uttered it!","We often forget who’s in control of our journey. We plan as if everything is guaranteed. As if we’ll get everything we want. But the Almighty has shown us, especially during this pandemic that we should appreciate everything that we have. He can take away anything, anytime!","Learn to wait patiently. Not with a bad attitude. When you see friends being blessed, be happy for them. Pray for their well-being so the Almighty might grant you the same favours. Your turn will come. Live by this principle: when it wasn’t my turn, I never hated. I just waited!","Feel hopeless? Feel like the world is caving in on you? Feel like you’re in total darkness with no light at the end of the tunnel? Remember, no matter what you’re going through, that one sincere prayer can change your entire life. Where there’s hope, there’s life. Always!","The greater the obstacles, the greater the victory. Don’t complain when your test is a difficult one. The Almighty tests those He loves most. He’ll keep testing us. There’s a purpose behind the trial. Tests are a way to purify us. Embrace it. You’ll realize its value eventually!","How you live your life daily matters. Are you sowing seeds of goodness so you can reap them later or are you doing whatever you feel like. Don’t waste your short time in this world. Sow seeds of positivity, gratitude, love, hope etc and see how it impacts those around you.","Almighty. Forgive us for trying to fix things on our own. Forgive us for running around seeking help when we should be turning to You. Forgive us for forgetting how much we need You above everyone &amp; everything else. You know our pain, burden &amp; cares. Heal us. Make us whole again!","Let’s be honest about it. From time to time, we all do foolish things. We make mistakes. As long as we acknowledge our shortcomings and seek forgiveness, nothing we do is beyond the capacity of the Almighty to forgive. Remember, we make mistakes. He doesn’t! He’s perfect!"
